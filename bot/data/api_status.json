Aangezien er bij de Noordboom veel aandacht wordt geschonken aan de luchtdichtheid van de projecten, dient er met evenveel aandacht worden omgegaan met de goede ventilatie van het gebouw. Dit is noodzakelijk (en wettelijk verplicht) voor een gezond binnenklimaat. Het ventilatiesysteem wordt letterlijk verweven in de houtskelet, en zo goed als mogelijk weggewerkt, om een proper afgewerkt eindresultaat te bekomen. Om dit te kunnen garanderen hebben wij een eigen ploeg in dienst voor de installatie van het volledige systeem in uw woning. Houtskeletbouw of houtmassiefbouw (bvb.

The Great Devon Trash Bash, formerly called the Community Clean Up, is this Sunday, April 21st. Devon families, youth groups, community organizations and businesses are being encouraged to get out and get involved by putting together a team to pick up litter. Tim Horton's Devon is demonstrating its commitment to this community event by giving a re-useable mug to each member of the teams that register in advance. Tim Horton's Devon has also supplied the event with garbage bags and gloves to include in the team kits. To register, contact Kristin Walsh, Recreation Coordinator for the Town of Devon at 780-987-8331 or by email at kwalsh@devon.ca. Teams can choose to clean up their neighbourhood, a favourite park, a section of trail or anywhere in town (excluding the highway) that needs a good spring clean.",
