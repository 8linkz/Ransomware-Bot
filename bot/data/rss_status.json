Then we head to the checkout aisle to ask why JavaScript on payment pages went feral, and how new PCI DSS rules are finally muzzling Magecart-style skimmers. Plus: Graham reveals his new-found superpower with Keyboard Maestro, and Scott describes a slick new way to whip up beautiful how-to videos with Screen Studio. All this and more is discussed in episode 440 of \"Smashing Security\" podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Scott Helme.",

Also, we learn how Geoffrey Hinton and Steve Wozniak have teamed up with the unlikely coupling of will.i.am and Steve Bannon to pull the brakes on \"super-intelligence.\" Meanwhile, Graham wonders if you should really trust an AI browser with your passwords, or your credit card, or, frankly, anything at all, and Mark reveals what AGI really means - and how close we are to reaching it. It’s an episode packed with deepfaked sidebars, brain-rotted AIs, and humans who still can’t take selfies properly. All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of \"The AI Fix\" podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.",

      "description": "Aisuru, the botnet responsible for a series of record-smashing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this year, recently was overhauled to support a more low-key, lucrative and sustainable business: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic. Experts says a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.",

      "description": "The Department of Justice has indicted thirty-one people over the high-tech rigging of high-stakes poker games. In a typical legitimate poker game, a dealer uses a shuffling machine to shuffle the cards randomly before dealing them to all the players in a particular order. As set forth in the indictment, the rigged games used altered shuffling machines that contained hidden technology allowing the machines to read all the cards in the deck. Because the cards were always dealt in a particular order to the players at the table, the machines could determine which player would have the winning hand. This information was transmitted to an off-site member of the conspiracy, who then transmitted that information via cellphone back to a member of the conspiracy who was playing at the table, referred to as the \u0026#8220;Quarterback\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;Driver.\u0026#8221; The Quarterback then secretly signaled this information (usually by prearranged signals like touching certain chips or other items on the table) to other co-conspirators playing at the table, who were also participants in the scheme. Collectively, the Quarterback and other players in on the scheme (i.e., the cheating team) used this information to win poker games against unwitting victims, who sometimes lost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time. The defendants used other cheating technology as well, such as a chip tray analyzer (essentially, a poker chip tray that also secretly read all cards using hidden cameras), an x-ray table that could read cards face down on the table, and special contact lenses or eyeglasses that could read pre-marked cards. ...",

Then, receipts became computerized, and faking them required some artistic skills to make the page look realistic.

Experts say while the proposed ban may have more to do with TP-Link's ties to China than any specific technical threats, much of the rest of the industry serving this market also sources hardware from China and ships products that are insecure fresh out of the box.",

I\u0026#8217;ve written about this before: Almost all cloud services have to perform some computation on our data. Even the simplest storage provider has code to copy bytes from an internal storage system and deliver them to the user. End-to-end encryption is sufficient in such a narrow context. But often we want our cloud providers to be able to perform computation on our raw data: search, analysis, AI model training or fine-tuning, and more. Without expensive, esoteric techniques, such as secure multiparty computation protocols or homomorphic encryption techniques that can perform calculations on encrypted data, cloud servers require access to the unencrypted data to do anything useful...",

Although hack backs can take on various forms, they are\u0026#8212;­by definition­\u0026#8212;not passive defensive measures.\u0026#8221; His conclusion: As the law currently stands, specific forms of purely defense measures are authorized so long as they affect only the victim’s system or data. At the other end of the spectrum, offensive measures that involve accessing or otherwise causing damage or loss to the hacker’s systems are likely prohibited, absent government oversight or authorization. And even then parties should proceed with caution in light of the heightened risks of misattribution, collateral damage, and retaliation...",

Nobody knew anything. The manufacturers didn\u0026#8217;t know whether the cryptography they sold was any good. The customers didn\u0026#8217;t know whether the crypto they bought was any good. Everyone pretended to know, thought they knew, or knew better than to even try to know. The Business of Secrets is the self-published memoirs of Fred Kinch. He was founder and vice president of\u0026#8212;mostly sales\u0026#8212;at a US cryptographic hardware company called Datotek, from company\u0026#8217;s founding in 1969 until 1982.

That\u0026#8217;s a fact-based question. \u0026#8220;What\u0026#8217;s the right thing to do here?\u0026#8221; is a human-based question...",

      "description": "Short-finned pilot wales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) eat at lot of squid: To figure out a short-finned pilot whale\u0026#8217;s caloric intake, Gough says, the team had to combine data from a variety of sources, including movement data from short-lasting tags, daily feeding rates from satellite tags, body measurements collected via aerial drones, and sifting through the stomachs of unfortunate whales that ended up stranded on land. Once the team pulled all this data together, they estimated that a typical whale will eat between 82 and 202 squid a day. To meet their energy needs, a whale will have to consume an average of 140 squid a day. Annually, that\u0026#8217;s about 74,000 squid per whale. For all the whales in the area, that amounts to about 88,000 tons of squid eaten every year...",
